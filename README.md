## Configuration

Config files in `plugins/PotionGamesX/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **config.yml** | Global settings, database, shops, kits |
| **lobbies.yml** | Lobbies, arenas, spawn locations |
| **chests.yml** | Chest loot item definitions |
| **messages.yml** | Localized text messages |
| **kits.yml** | Kit definitions |
| **shop.yml** | Shop items |

Settings use a lobby-first model:
- `pg.defaults.*` stores global defaults for every lobby
- `pg.lobbies.<id>.settings.*` stores per-lobby overrides
- Falls back to defaults if per-lobby setting is missing
